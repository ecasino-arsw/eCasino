##  Repository management rules

Commits have to be verified in order to be allowed, this means that the author's name and email has to be updated before commitinfg and pushing. The commit message has to be short and descriptive.

In order to mantain code intergrity, the members of the organization cannot push directly to the master branch. Instead, thay have to create a branch with their username to be merged by the organization administrator afterwards. This will allow us to keep our local repositories updated and be aware of recent changes to not overwrite them.

In addition to this, the commits will have an especial syntax as the repository is connected to Taiga, and commit messages will update issues or tasks status to close them. See the following links to know more:
